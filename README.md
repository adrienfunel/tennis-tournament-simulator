# tennis-tournament-simulator
Service designed to simulate a multi-player tennis tournament and provide the outcome

## Description



## Requirements

 The code must compile (if applicable for the language chosen) and run without crashes/errors.
 The tournament should be a single-elimination tournament.
 The simulation should work for any number of players between 2 and 64 inclusive.
 There are no concrete requirements on the input/output formats but the simulation should be able
to produce data such as a list of all games played and their results.
 You may make reasonable assumptions about anything not explicitly mentioned in this document, as
long as your assumptions do not oversimplify the exercise. For example, simulating an entire match
with a 50/50 coin toss is too much.
